- CASTER CUSTOM PALETTE SUPPORT

As of v1.5, released 07/10/09, custom color palettes are now supported in
netplay! Any palettes you set or create will be sent to the other player
when you select them. Please try not to use ones that interfere with
gameplay.

As of v1.7, released 07/11/26, it now includes a default set that fills all
of the slots. Simply copy it along with the rest of Caster.

See the included palette directory for credits information and whatnot.

- HOW DO I SELECT CUSTOM PALETTES?

When in the character select screen, hold up or down when pressing A or D to
select your character.

The inputs line up to these colors:

    Up+A / 8A : color 1
    Up+D / 8D : color 2
  Down+A / 2A : color 3
  Down+D / 2D : color 4

- HOW DO I MAKE MY OWN PALETTES?

http://iamp.mizuumi.net/index.php/Color_editor

Should have all that you need.

IMPORTANT: Custom colors edited directly into th075.dat and th075b.dat will
NOT be transferred. It is recommended that you leave those alone unless you
really want them to be different normally.

- HOW DO I GET CASTER TO RECOGNIZE MY PALETTES?

Create a folder named "palette" in the directory that contains th075.exe and
RollCaster.exe. Then, simply save your custom colors in there in the following
naming scheme:

Character-n.pal , where n is the number of the color from 1 to 4.

Examples:
  palette\Reimu-1.pal
  palette\Marisa-3.pal
  palette\Sakuya-2.pal
  palette\Alice-1.pal
  palette\Youmu-2.pal
  palette\Patchouli-4.pal
  palette\Remilia-1.pal
  palette\Yuyuko-3.pal
  palette\Yukari-2.pal
  palette\Suika-4.pal
  palette\Meiling-1.pal

And so forth. There are four color slots for each character, so a maximum of
44 additional color slots have been added with RollCaster.

- GOOD LORD, THE OTHER GUY'S COLORS ARE HIDEOUS, HOW DO I TURN THEM OFF?

There are two options. One is to set processRemotePalettes to 1 or 2 in
config_caster.ini, the other is to press the '(apostrophe) key while on the
character select menu to cycle processRemotePalettes. This key is
configurable in the [KEYBIND] section of config_caster.ini

- WOW, THE OTHER GUY'S COLORS ARE COOL, HOW DO I SAVE THEM?

Press '(apostrophe) while in a match. This key is configurable in the
[KEYBIND] section of config_caster.ini

Note that this is different from the function the key has at the character
select menu.

- HOW DO I VIEW THESE IN REPLAYS?

You don't, unless you edit them into th075.dat or th075b.dat. Sorry.

- WOW THE DEFAULT PALETTE COLORS SUCK

A lot of them do!

Replace them with your own!
