- SETTING UP CASTER
------------------------------------------------------------------

Step by step guide:
#1 - Patch IaMP to 1.11. The patch may be found at:
     http://www.tasofro.net/touhou/download.html
     or
     http://wiki.mizuumi.net/stuff/th075_111s.exe

#2 - If you have not unlocked all characters already, download and
     use the full unlock file:
     http://wiki.mizuumi.net/stuff/tools/score.dat

#3 - Copy RollCaster.exe and config_rollcaster.ini from the exe
     folder to the exact same folder that th075.exe is in.

#4 - Edit config_rollcaster.ini to your preferences.
     Such as your player name.

#5 - Stop anything that might interfere with RollCaster: Most
     notably anything that runs GameGuard.

#6 - Run RollCaster, select 9: vs th075Booster. If all is well,
     you will be brought to the character select screen.

#7 - Use 1 to host a game, or 2 to connect to another user.
     RollCaster will automatically calculate a recommended delay
     value when you connect to each other.

#8 - For matchmaking, setup IRC and go to irc.mizuumi.net #iamp
     Be warned that the players there can be very skilled, but
     people will listen if you ask to not play someone strong.

=== Troubleshooting:

- If you see a CharInit() error, there is a problem with your pad
  configuration.

- For anything else, you probably did something wrong.

=== Router issues:

- If you are behind a router, you will need to forward port 7500
  to your computer in order to host to host. This is not required
  to connect to another user.
  - You may use 8: Test myPort to see if your port is open.
    Simply use it on mizuumi.net to see if it works.

- If neither user can forward ports, then you may connect to each
  other through a relay.
  Simply have both users use 7: Relay on mizuumi.net and, as
  long as no one else is trying to connect, it should connect you
  to each other. See below for more information.
  Relay connections are a DIRECT CONNECTION and do not add lag.

- If _that_ fails, you'll probably need to go get Hamachi, but
  this should be considered a last resort.
  (Hamachi is, however, much better than it used to be. Just make
   sure you have a direct connection with it!)

=== !!! IMPORTANT NOTE: !!!

Replays recorded with Caster will NOT play back correctly in IaMP.
This is because of a desync fix.

To fix this, you will need a replay watcher.

The latest version and usage instructions may be found at:
http://wiki.mizuumi.net/w/Immaterial_and_Missing_Power/th075tool

A direct download of th075tool and the old replay watcher if needed:
http://mauve.sandwich.net/iamp/th075tool-20120211.zip

http://mauve.sandwich.net/iamp/ReplayEx015.zip

=== Linux support:

Linux support is in as of the 080815 version. It is not complete,
as hotkeys still don't work, but it's enough to get you up and
running and able to play the game online without much trouble.

It does require a lot more processing power than the Windows
version, especially with rollbacks, so be ready.

There is occasionally a problem where exiting IaMP will cause
sound to cut out. For your entire system. I have absolutely no
idea what causes this, but it can be 'fixed' by running th075e.exe
or something through wine normally.

  ABOUT ROLLCASTER
------------------------------------------------------------------

th075Caster is a netplay tool for the game Touhou Suimusou:
Immaterial and Missing Power.

RollCaster is a mod for th075Caster that adds a huge pile of
new features, including replay renaming, a practice dummy,
customized player palettes, and of course GGPO/nFBA-style
netplay rollbacks.

RollCaster was originally named CowCaster, before rollbacks
were added.

This is maintained by mauve of irc.mizuumi.net's #iamp IRC
channel, please stop by if you have any comments.

The latest version of RollCaster may always be found at:

- USING CASTER
------------------------------------------------------------------

When you get to the main menu, you'll see a bunch of options.
Here's a short rundown of what they do.

0 : Exit
    Quits RollCaster.

1 : Host
    Hosts for a game.

2 : Connect
    Connects to an address.

3 : Spectate
    Spectates a game at an address.
    Waits until the game starts.

4 : Local 2P Game
    Plays a local two player game through Caster.
    This allows spectating.

5 : Get Information
    Tells you the current state of another Caster.

6 : Connect (Persistent mode)
    Connects to an address and disallows timeouts.
    It's never gonna give it up and it's never gonna let it down.

7 : Relay (aka Standby)
    Uses a server to connect two players to each other.
    Both players use at the same time for this.

8 : Test hosting port
    Checks to see if you are capable of hosting a game.

9 : vs th075Booster / Debug mode
    Plays a local, one player game against either booster or
    an idle debug mode.

10: vs Practice Dummy
    Uses RollCaster's practice dummy mode. It's buggy and
    unreliable but hey, it's what you get.

11: Script
    Uses th075Caster's experimental lua scripting.

------------------------------------------------------------------
- AUTOMATIC REPLAY SAVING AND NAMING
------------------------------------------------------------------

Automatic replay saving is a special feature of rollCaster.
To turn it on, simply edit config_rollcaster.ini and set
autoSave to 1.

You can also skip replay saving entirely by setting it to 2.

Pressing - and = in game will turn it off and on, respectively.

RollCaster also supports automatic replay file naming.
config_rollcaster.ini has the details.

------------------------------------------------------------------
- CUSTOM PALETTES
------------------------------------------------------------------

RollCaster allows custom palettes.

Please read the included Palette.txt for information.

------------------------------------------------------------------
- HOTKEY LIST
------------------------------------------------------------------

These are the default keys. You may reconfigure them in the
[KEYBIND] portion of config_caster.ini

------------------------------------------------------------------
- TH075BOOSTER
------------------------------------------------------------------

Booster is an enhanced AI that learns from playing. Without any
data files it won't do anything, though.

See http://wiki.mizuumi.net/w/Immaterial_and_Missing_Power/th075booster
for more information, as well as th075Booster in config_rollcaster.ini

------------------------------------------------------------------
- COMMAND LINE PARAMETERS
------------------------------------------------------------------

The following command line parameters may be passed to Caster:

-w         Automatically go into wait mode.
-i ip      Caster will automatically try to connect to the address.
-p port    Sets the port used for the -i parameter.
-s ip      Caster will automatically try to spectate the address.
-f         Uses info.ini to do the connection.
           It can be set to:
           - Wait for a connection
           - Wait for a connection from a specific IP.
           - Connect to an IP set in the file
           See info.ini for more details.

------------------------------------------------------------------
- ENHANCED PRACTICE DUMMY
------------------------------------------------------------------

The practice dummy is a special feature of RollCaster added to
help with training.

The menu should be pretty self-explanatory.

As AI goes is pretty much extremely dumb and can sometimes get hit
even when it really shouldn't. Its guard reactions have a short
delay, be ready for it if you use them.
