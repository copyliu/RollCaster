  - Name changed from CowCaster to RollCaster.
  - Changes file starting over.
  - Features:
    - Netplay rollbacks!
      This is a major upgrade to netplay, using GGPO/NFBA-style rollbacks to
      drastically reduce input delay and improve overall play.
      - Fully backwards compatible with CowCaster and th075Caster.
      - Can configure minimum input delay and maximum rewind frames.
      - New timing loop used when rollbacks are enabled:
        - Consistent, accurate 60FPS
        - More accurate FPS counter
        - Synchronization order more optimal for handling rollbacks
      - Hold shift when pressing a delay number key to set rewind amount.
      - Random stage select now never produces banned stages.
      - Camera softening to reduce visual jitter.
    - No longer prompts for name on startup.
    - Menu text finally in English!

      normal and advanced sections.
    - [ROLLBACK] section added. See ini file for information.
    - origMenu added. Allows original menu text to be used.

      accepts the suggested delay and starts the match.
